Bot will be a selection you can make when creating the game. If it is invoked,
the script will be called every time it is the opponent's turn.

It will need to know the following at the beginning of each of its turns:
-its total troop count
-total enemy troop count
-its hexes (coordinates, troop count)
-the neighbors of its hexes (coordinates, troop counts, resources)
-its next neighbors an extra hex away (coordinates, troop counts, resources)
-its resources
-opponent resources



IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE
Check for immediate enemy proximity
  If it would win, give high priority
  If it would lose, give moving away high priority
    Lower priority, but still high, if it can do a lot of damage even in a loss
  Store enemy proximities in an array with levels of importance, as well as which types of
    units its lacking in and by how much

By purchasing units it can afford, could it turn an imminent failure into a draw or a win?
  Which units, and where? Those get top priority and are purchased outright.
  For hexes with enemies two hexes away, what kinds of troops would help in a fight? Can
    any of them be afforded now? If so, buy them.
  If none of these are necessary this turn, do not buy, but instead buy next turn to be
    reactive.

Check for immediate resource proximity
  All immediate resource hexes are given high priority, but especially those that could
    be used to buy units next turn, and especially units that will be needed in a fight
  In the event of a tie, defer to hexes which would allow it to buy a more diverse army.
  Resource hexes up to two spaces away are given a medium priority, but if that resource
    could be used to buy units the AI needs, it is given high priority.

Decide how to spend the three moves, based on priority.
For each of those three moves, first assume all units are moving.
If that move will result in a combat, bring as many units as necessary to win.
